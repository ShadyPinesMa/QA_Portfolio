## **1\. Introduction** {#1.-introduction}

### 1.1 Objective {#1.1-objective}

This test plan exists to inform team members of the test approach. It includes the objectives, scope, assumptions/risks, and test schedule. This document will also identify the test deliverables, as well as what is deemed in and out of scope.

## **2\. Scope of testing** {#2.-scope-of-testing}

	The scope of this testing project is the modules of “Sweetshop.co” as defined below.

### 2.1 In-scope {#2.1-in-scope}

	Functional automated testing will be conducted on the following modules:

- Home Page:  
  * Products link  
  * Login link  
  * Basket link  
- Login Page:  
  * Email error  
  * Password error  
- Products Page:  
  * Add items to basket  
  * Link to basket page  
- Account Page:  
  * Number of orders displayed  
  * Pasts transactions displayed  
- Basket Page:  
  * Basket showing correct items  
  * Customer information errors  
  * Credit card information errors  
  * Checkout process

### 2.2 Out of scope {#2.2-out-of-scope}

	All forms of non-functional testing are out of scope for this testing project. Some examples of non-functional testing are listed below:

* Load/stress testing  
* User Experience testing  
* Security testing  
* Performance testing

## **3\. Assumptions/Risks** {#3.-assumptions/risks}

### 3.1 Assumptions {#3.1-assumptions}

	Testing will be done on the live website and the defects will be tracked in Google Sheets. Developers will have access to the bug tracking Google Sheet and will be monitoring the defects on a daily basis. Defect fixes will be delivered to the scrum team at least 1 day before the sprint end day so that the testing team can retest and close the defect in the same sprint. Any defects of high priority and high severity will be fixed within 1 day and turned over to the testing team for retesting.

### 3.2 Risks {#3.2-risks}

| Risks | Mitigation |
| ----- | ----- |
| Insufficient resources (manpower, lack of access to appropriate tools) to execute all of the test cases before the end of sprint. | Defects will be tested based on priority. Any open defects remaining at the end of the sprint will be moved to the next sprint, based on priority. |
| Defects are found late in the sprint and there is insufficient time to fix defect before the end of sprint | Defects added late in the sprint (later than 1 day before the sprint end day) will be moved to the next sprint, based on priority. |

## **4\. Test Approach** {#4.-test-approach}

	Testing will be executed using the Scrum-Agile methodology. The scrum team will participate in the following scrum events:

* Sprint Planning  
* Daily Scrum  
* Sprint Review  
* Sprint Retrospective

### 4.1 Test Schedule {#4.1-test-schedule}

	

| Activity | Dates |

## **5\. Deliverables** {#5.-deliverables}

The following deliverables will be assembled by the testing team during this project:

* Test Plan  
* Test Cases  
* Test Summary Report

## **6\. Tools Used** {#6.-tools-used}

* PyCharm: used to write the page object models (POMs), write automated tests, and carry out the tests  
* Selenium Web Driver: browser automation tool used for testing purposes  
* PyTest: testing framework used  
* Google Sheets: used to create and log test scenarios and test cases. Also used for defect tracking  
* Google Documents: used to create the test plan and test summary report

## **7\. Test Data** {#7.-test-data}

	The testing team will be developing test data as part of the testing procedure. Existing data from the live website will be used depending on the test cases. For the specific test data used, please view the project (SweetShopTest) in PyCharm. It contains data added for specific tests and a CSV file used for user flow verification

## **8\. Stakeholders \- roles and responsibilities** {#8.-stakeholders---roles-and-responsibilities}

	Product owner: responsible for defining requirements and acceptance criteria, prioritizing project backlog, providing sign off on deliverables  
	Scrum master: responsible for facilitating the scrum team and removing impediments to progress  
	Developers: responsible for developing the application, fixing defects and assigning defects to testing team  
	Testers: responsible for testing the application, logging and tracking defects, and providing testing reports to stakeholders 

### 8.1 Project Team  {#8.1-project-team}
